    """Aligns the serial stream with the incoming Spektrum packets
    Spektrum Remote Receivers (AKA Spektrum Satellite) communicate serially
    in 16 byte packets at 125000 bits per second (bps)(aka baud) but are
    compatible with the standard 115200bps rate. We don't control the output
    transmission timing of the Spektrum receiver unit and so might start
    reading from the serial port in the middle of a packet transmission.
    To align the reading from the serial port with the packet transmission,
    we use the timing between packets to detect the interval between packets
    Packets are communicated every 11ms. At 115200 bps, a bit is read in 
    approximately 8.69us, so a 16 byte (128 bit)
    packet will take around 1.11ms to be communicated, leaving a gap of about
    9.89ms between packets. We align our serial port reading with the protocol
    by detecting this gap between reads.
    Note that we do not use the packet header contents because
        1) They are product dependent. Specifically, "internal" Spektrum
        receivers indicate the system protocol in the second byte of the header
        but "external" receivers do not. Further, different products are
        use different protocols and indicate this using the
        system protocol byte.
        2) Other bytes in the packet may take on the same value as the header
        contents. No bit patterns of a byte are reserved, so any byte in the
        data payload of the packet could match the values of the header bytes.
